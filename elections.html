        <p>The elections will take place on the 15th of March 2017 and will be held to determine the distribution of the 150 seats in the Tweede Kamer over all political parties. The seats in the Eerste Kamer will be distributed according to the distribution of the seats in the Tweede Kamer.</p>

        <p>Voting is done at voting booths which can be found at numerous places in all cities. Voting can either be done on an individual member of a particular party or the voter can choose to vote blank. Voting blank could result in a seat being left empty, however, this has never happened. Furthermore, if a single member gets the amount of votes such that that member passes the threshold needed to acquire a seat, then he will get that seat. The party that member belongs to then has a seat. The threshold required to have a seat is calculated by dividing the amount of votes by 150, the total amount of seats. Because of this system, there will always be a couple of seats remaining, which are then divided among parties dependent on which party has the most remaining votes.</p>
